# Add at least 3 Project features


- ***Home Page:** This code implements a dynamic search feature in the "Home" component. Users can input a category name in a search field, and when they submit the query, the code filters the list of donations based on the entered category name. It uses React's state management to update the displayed donations, showing only those that match the search criteria. If no query is entered, it displays all donations. This feature improves user interaction by allowing them to easily find and view donations of specific categories, making the interface more user-friendly and responsive.
-  **Cards:** Each donation card is wrapped in a Link component from "react-router-dom," making the entire card clickable. When a user clicks on a card, it navigates them to a detailed view of that donation, thanks to the dynamic URL generated with the donation's unique id. This feature enhances user experience by providing an intuitive way to explore more details about a specific donation, making the project user-friendly and improving navigation within the application.
- **Donation Statistics Visualization:** The "Statistics" component uses the "recharts" library to create a dynamic pie chart that visually represents donation statistics. It fetches data about the user's donations and total donations, calculates the remaining available donations, and displays them as a pie chart. Each section of the chart represents "Total Donations" and "Your Donations," with different colors for clarity. The chart is interactive and displays the percentage of each category. This feature helps users quickly grasp and visualize their contribution relative to the total donations, making it easier to track their impact within the projec
